      <li><strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong></li>
      <li>Using a car as an analogy: HTML would be the different parts that make up its structure. The chassis, the windows, the wheels. CSS would determine the look of the vehicle. Its paintjob, its model. Finally, the DOM would be the plans/blueprints to put the car together. Tweaks here and there allow you to make changes to the car's design and its final look.</li>

      <li><strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong></li>
        <li>It conceptualises the design of a webpage as a series of boxes that contain content.</li>

      <li><strong>What is the box model?</strong></li>
        <li>Using a box shape as the base, one can define non-box appearances through the magic of CSS.</li>
