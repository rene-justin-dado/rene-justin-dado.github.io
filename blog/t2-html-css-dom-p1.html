      <li><strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong></li>
        <p>Using a car as an analogy<br>
        HTML would be the different parts that make up its structure. The chassis, the windows, the wheels.<br>CSS would determine the look of the vehicle. Its paintjob, its model.<br>Finally, the DOM would be the plans/blueprints to put the car together. Tweaks here and there allow you to make changes to the car's design and its final look.</p><br>

      <li><strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong></li>
        <p>It conceptualises the design of a webpage as a series of boxes that contain content.</p><br>

      <li><strong>What is the box model?</strong></li>
        <p>Using a box shape as the base, one can define non-box appearances through the magic of CSS.</p>
