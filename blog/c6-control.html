          <p>That it turns out, I've known how to be mindful for a while now. Not necessarily in a consistent, practiced or even deliberate way, but there are themes and concepts that keep coming up that sound like the way I just decide to handle things in my day-to-day life. I <em>do</em> appreciate that there's a lot of emphasis on letting emotions do their thing. Realising that they are an immutable part of the human experience and that, although you can never stop feeling, you can always decide <em><strong>how</strong></em> you'll deal with your experiences.</p>

          <p>The event that came to mind is something that I've known will be lingering for a while. I did a mindful check of the situation the moment it happened. Maybe It'll lurk around the outskirts of my thoughts for a while longer, maybe forever, but either way It's good to think that all I have to do is let it come and go while I keep living and growing. There's no looking back, only my strong, steady march forward.</p>
