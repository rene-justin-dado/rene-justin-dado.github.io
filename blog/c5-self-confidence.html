          <p>As far as 'Search Inside Yourself' is concerned, they're basically the same thing. I think of it more in the zone of; self-awareness is having a great degree of mindfulness concerning yourself. When you practice being mindful and pay attention to how you react to your environment and the reasons why, you <em>become</em> self-aware.</p>

          <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>

          <p>Body Scanning put me to sleep! Just as promised. It was relaxing, at the very least. :)<br>
          Then I tried the Journaling and maybe I misread something, but I wasn't expecting to do the exercise and tap into the emotions that I did. The first two prompts were great. They really lifted me up; Felt like I was floating. That was a good time to look back at how I've faced and overcome challenges in this course, so far. And then I did the next couple of prompts. One big thing came to mind and the emotions themselves weren't surprising, What caught me off-guard was that I just wasn't expecting a prompt that would bring me to that space in my head. Regardless, the exercise was good and going from some of my highs to lows makes me feel more human. It makes me feel that i'm no longer standing still.</p>

          <p>I read through it and thought; That's actually quite relatable. I remember when I was young, I used to think that feelings were just natural waves of behaviour change. When you feel something, you very much <em>are</em> that emotion and when you feel that way, people better be ready to adjust to <em>your</em> state of mind. I don't know when it was that I started changing my perception of it and began to think about how separate emotions could be from me. That I could feel upset and still cheer up those I love. Or I could be totally elated, and still come down off my high to express some empathy and show a loved one that I understand when they're struggling with something.</p>
