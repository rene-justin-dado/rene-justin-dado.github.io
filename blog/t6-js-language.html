          <p>Parens (parentheses) are used for <em>so</em> many things. They're math operators used to force an equation to prioritise solving one part first. <code>5 * (2 + 1) = 15</code> They're used to enclose arguments to a block of code. <code>function (argument) {do stuff}</code> Here, the code you put in between parens tells the function what code to reference when it performs its task. They're also good for grouping different data types together <code>if ( ((1 + 1) + 'turtle doves') ) {'It's the second day of xmas}</code></p>

          <h5>brackets []</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one blog-post">
          <p>These are nice. They let you declare arrays and then access a value from both arrays and objects. With arrays it's pretty straightforward <code>[3]</code> gets the value in the fourth 'box' in the array (the count starts from 0, remember?) And here's a lengthier explanation for objects. An object stores not just a numbered box like the array. It has a property/value <em>pair</em>
          <pre>
          <code>var object = {
          key1: value1,
          key 2: value2
          }
          </code>
          </pre> In this case <code>object.key1</code> gives us value1. But to get value2 we need <code>object[key 2]</code> since we're checking a property that had a space. It's a similar case for checking values based on a pre-defined variable or an argument.</p>

          <p>One word. Blocks. You must've already noticed that i've been using these braces. They just say; all code inside us shall henceforth belong to the preceding function, if statement or loop.</p>

        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one blog-post">
          <p>These are essentially interchangeable markers for strings. It mainly becomes a question of 'what do I want to display?' Whatever quotes happen to be outside will mark it's contents as a string. So <code>'Mary's little lamb'</code> would be confusing to your computer. It wouldn't know whether to end the string after Mary's quote or the quote after lamb. Double quotes here would keep the poor computer from getting a headache. :3</p>
