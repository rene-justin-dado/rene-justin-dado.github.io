          <p>Familiar and very true. Pleasure only ever amounts to a little pocket of joy. It's pointless to focus your efforts around how much cake you can eat in one sitting. One needs passion and a purpose to express one's self and produce the situations to become the person one intends to be.</p>

        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one blog-post">
          <p>It's nice every now and then to look at things a bit more objectively. I feel like that's what this type of meditation exercise allows one to do. Perceiving that separation between the physiological effects of an experience and one's identity and values helps to highlight how unnecessary it is to cling to one experience or another. Who I am is not what I feel, it's something so much more, so much better.</p>
