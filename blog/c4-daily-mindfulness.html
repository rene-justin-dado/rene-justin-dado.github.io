          <p>That it's very much outside of the way I would normally carry a conversation. It's much more attention-driven, where it's not about just hearing a story, it's also about creating a full awareness of the meaning behind what you're hearing rather than having a knee-jerk response to what's being said. The other person was Reuben, if memory serves, he mentioned how looping was a nice practice to ensure that both parties get their thoughts across accurately and vividly.</p>

          <p>I think i'll try to do a bit of everything. Having a buddy sounds great and I have a few candidates i'd like to proposition for practice. Regular training below your threshold, I think I already enjoy doing that. XD <br>
          Also, i'm already chill, so remembering to do just <em>any</em> amount of meditation will work out pretty well for me.</p>

          <p>I liked the analogy concerning babies that are learning to walk. It's always nice to know when you're training in a skill that may not produce very apparent results immediately.</p>
