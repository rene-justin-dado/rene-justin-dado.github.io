          <p>I was never too impressed about the practice. It's the kind of thing that's very much associated with mysticism and superstition, but if there are good, measurable outcomes, then I think it's worth looking into.</p>

          <p>I've heard of it being suggested by psychotherapists as a way to combat depression, so I get how it's associated with more positive emotions. Emotional control/mastery was also an easy one to realise, seeing that the whole point is to be aware of and control ones reactions to external stimuli during meditation.</p>

        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one">
          <p>Focusing on one's intention to start off was probably the most helpful to me since I started off a bit more skeptical about the meditation stuff. It's also a bit more familiar to my usual way of goal-oriented thinking. It helps me to stay in-the-zone if I have an idea of what I want to get out of the experience.</p>

          <p>I'm a bit of a rebel, so I come up with my own meditation training situations for these bits. ;) Like, for this time around, instead of focusing on breathing I put focus on my sight; so I picked up one of my art books (Heart of the Swarm) with the attention of just appreciating the composition of the art in it.</p>
