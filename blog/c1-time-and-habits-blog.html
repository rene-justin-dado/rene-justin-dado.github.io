          <p>I've managed to stumble into the <em>Growth Mindset</em> on accident (or maybe not?). I've had success jumping into phase-0 with this in mind and have been playing around with resources and tools ever since I applied. (it's really just treating study like play time) I'm also planning out the future in increments.  The Toggl timer in conjunction with the Pomodoro technique was another one of those techniques that I tried out.</p>

          <p>The Pomodoro technique has been pretty cool. (I'm loosey-goosey with the breaks, though. XD) Sometimes I get to the end of a 25 minute period and i'm relieved that I can feel good about taking a break to just mess around for a bit. Then there's those times that I eloquently discuss an alternative with the timer; "<b>SHUTUPI'MNOTDONE</b>"" and keep going. (don't hold that against me :P)
          <br>
          As mentioned, I've got a Growth Mindset going into this journey, but I think I like the idea of how <em>Meditation</em> and <em>Mindfulness</em> could also be nice supporting techniques to leverage. I've dabbled a bit in each and I <em>am</em> feeling Mindfulness > Meditation at the moment. I think there are ways I can apply Mindfulness such that I can support what i'm currently learning, but still lay the foundations to start focusing on developing other skills later on.</p>

          <p>My version of Pomodoro, which I shall dub the Formaggio (because tomato and cheese sandwich, that's why!) technique, where I might sometimes play fast and loose with how I handle breaks. Also, having the mindset of <em>do first then assess yourself</em> has been very familiar to me. (It's very much a gaming mindset, I think)</p>

          <p>Pomodoro has been really good. Not only for tracking time, but feeling great that I <em><b>know</b> for sure</em> that when I think back to what I did during a particular day I can think: <b>I was awesome today! And I have Toggl as proof!</b> Of course I also wanna get back into doing Mindfulness training and maybe look into Meditation again.</p>
