          <p>I was getting errors with an exercise on freeCodeCamp called "Profile Lookup". As the title suggests, it's meant to look up certain information saved in a 'javascript object'. The problem was that it was meant to warn that a particular contact didn't exist if it couldn't find the name that was given, but it was <em>always</em> saying that it couldn't find data even when a particular person <em>did</em> have information in the object.</p>

          <p>I started off using 'console.log()' to see what the program was doing. That helped me look through the code and formulate some ideas for solutions. I had some pseudocode to help plan as well. After spending too much time on the problem with no progress, I did a google search and found a direct solution on 'stackOverflow'.</p>

          <p>Probably one of the most important and enlightening things about programming. Conditional statements let us control how, when and/or if things happen. But more importantly, 'control flow', which statements the program executes and in what order is also very important in determining the when-if-how a statement executes.</p>

          <p>It was an exercise on freeCodeCamp called "Record Collection". The problem was that the program needed to return a set of date based on some search information given to it and it would throw an error when it couldn't find an existing record of a property that was given.</p>

          <p>Reading the error being thrown and using 'console.log()' was the reason I found out what the problem was, in the first place. I had been struggling for a while at this point, so I reached out to Amandine. I wrote out some pseudocode to organise my plan to catch the problem. I tried out my new code in isolation (as in, I turned off other behaviours so I could watch the effects of this new statement). I tweaked code a few more times when problems came up and finally got to a solution with just one or two more statements, each responding based on the input given.</p>

          <p>It was very encouraging once I got Amandine's help. She basically dropped the solution in my lap. XD It was great to get over a block I had with someone's help.</p>

          <p>In this case, some more detail about how we access information from 'javascript objects'. Also, it was an opportunity to look very hard at how much time I let pass before asking help to find a solution.</p>

          <h5>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one">
          <p>I'm pretty confident with all the problem solving techniques. Of course, <em>console.logging</em> and <em>error messages</em> are only as helpful as the context dictates, but other than that; I love the fact that in the modern day we live in, we have access to essentially infinite information through the internet. And naturally, being a gamer, I love trying things out, especially from different angles and new ways. As for reflection, I'm sure there's still room for improvement there, (as well as with the other techniques) but I'm doing alright. I'm often making sure that, especially after a rough block, I'm looking back at the situation and thinking about how quickly I went for help and how much I explored the issue myself and what I did to finally solve the problem.</p>

        <h4>For this explanation, let's start by talking about how an array is essentially a list of data. Each piece of data in an array is stored in It's own <em>box</em> and can be accessed/interacted with.</h4>
      </div>
        <div class="three columns">
          <h5>.map()</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one">
          <p>This function lets you, essentially make a new array based on an existing array and apply any changes you want to that copy, thus leaving the original array unchanged.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="three columns">
          <h5>.filter()</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one">
          <p>This function, like the name suggests, creates a new array where the contents are <em>filtered</em> based on the conditions in another function. So if you filtered an array using a function that checks whether all the array's contents are numbers, the new array would only list data in the original array that <em>are</em> numbers.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="three columns">
          <h5>.reduce()</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one">
          <p>Don't let this function's name fool you. It's not about subtracting values, although it's capable of doing that. It's about reducing all the "<em>boxes</em>" in the array to a simpler, singular value. So it could take an array that had <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=fibonacci%20sequence">Fibonacci Sequence</a> and give you back the value that comes next (The total of the already existing sequence). It also allows you to arrays inside of another array into just one array that lists all the values together (an array with boxes of values, rather than boxes within boxes).</p>
