          <p> The situation; my girlfriend at the time was urging me to go back to university and finish a degree. I didn't want to. I wanted to make my own way in <em>any</em> other way possible.</p>

          <p>For me, it was drudgery. I didn't know how to express it at the time, but I wanted to feel that I was affecting the world. University felt like endless unengaging live performances. Talking about the world rather than actually doing something real and tangible. I felt I could accomplish more by getting to work and building up real skills in the <em>real</em> world. Not some artificial environment where I would just learn to parrot information and record it.</p>

          <p>She obviously knew that it was important nonetheless. As much as I didn't like it, it's the system we've had in place to, <em>theoretically</em>, develop skills and knowledge that will be recognised and desired and help one to achieve their goals. I've been a housekeeper for a while and this was a way to 'level up'.</p>
