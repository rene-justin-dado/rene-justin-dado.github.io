        <h1 class="col-6"><strong>What is grid based design?</strong></h1>
        <p class="col-6">Grid based design, as the name suggests, is about designing pages by using a grid framework.<br>A <em>grid</em> class would define the maximum width that elements inside it can take up, <em>row</em> would allow its child elements to change size within the <em>grid</em> structure, and <em>col</em> classes would change the elements' width according to the <em>grid</em> and <em>row</em> containers.</p>

        <h1 class="col-6"><strong>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</strong></h1>
        <p class="col-6">Because of the range of screen sizes available to users in the modern day, it becomes valuable to be able to present information based on those differences in screen sizes. Thus, it becomes good practice to allow your content to change size and/or hide/show itself according to the amount information a given screen size can display cleanly all at once.</p>

        <h1 class="col-6"><strong>What is semantic structure?</strong></h1>
        <p class="col-6">Semantic structure is all about how one communicates the meaning of content through the presentation of it. Imagine a webpage without a semantic structure; it would be like talking to a robot. (less 'Jarvis', more HAL 9000) By adding in the semantic structure, you can teach the robot use inflections and different tones to communicate ideas better based on context.</p>

        <h1 class="col-6"><strong>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</strong></h1>
        <p class="col-6">I definitely want to wrap my head around the grid framework better and practice semantic structure. I love story telling, so I feel it's very important to use semantic expressions no matter the medium.</p>
