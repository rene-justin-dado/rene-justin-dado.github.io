          <p>I feel that compassionate leadership is the only way to do things. It's the most basic requirement for leading others. Lacking compassion is one of the first steps to alienating your peers. It's only when leaders account for their teams' viewpoints that everyone can work effectively together.</p>

          <p>It's been a great experience so far. Nikau has been such a fantastic cohort. Everybody has been very supportive and down-to-earth. I'm not expecting it will be any different from that, moving forward. Except that hopefully, we'll all start feeling more competent with the tech we're learning as we move forward.</p>
