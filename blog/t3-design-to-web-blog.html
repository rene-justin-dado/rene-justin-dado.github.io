        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one">
          <p>As the name suggests, a responsive site is one that is able to respond to different conditions that exist across different browsers and systems. For example, a responsive site would resize text or even entire sections of content in <em>response</em> to changes in screen size, browser orientation and other possible factors.</p>

          <h5>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one">
          <p>The 'mobile first' design philosophy is all about designing websites primarily with mobile devices in mind. The theory is that by designing for mobile first, we don't alienate people who browse the net from their mobiles or tablets and avoid a lot of other issues that come from designing with just desktops in mind. That includes, but is not limited to, dealing with an exclusively touch-screen environment, having vastly limited screen size and loading resources that wouldn't be used on mobile at all.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one">
          <p>Frameworks are basically CSS blueprints. They are a set of CSS solutions put together, such that, simply having the appropriate semantic structure allows one to <em>easily</em> <aside>sarcastic</aside> style one's site based on what the framework is built to do.
          <br>
          i.e. 'Skeleton' allows for a clean, simple, responsive site; whilst one like 'Bootstrap' offers a lot more functionality and complexity.</p>

          <h5>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one">
          <p>A wireframe is to site planning what pseudocode is to real coding. <aside>Storyboarding to story-telling?</aside> It's just a simple, bare-bones depiction of what one may want their site to look like by the end of all their hard work.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="eight columns offset-by-one">
          <p>Kinda everything? It was a big process having to work from scratch and it was a bit of a gut-punch after having put some work into a simple site earlier on. I also had trouble with keeping my header centered. I figured out after a while that I ought to update the blog-template file with semantic structures more relevant to my own wireframes.</p>
